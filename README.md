1. Overview:
UrbanPulse is designed to help urban planners, policymakers, and researchers analyze and predict urban growth patterns. By leveraging various data sources and machine learning techniques, the project provides valuable insights into demographic trends, environmental impacts, and future urban development scenarios.

2. Features:
Comprehensive data collection from multiple sources (Census, EPA, USGS, etc.)
Advanced data analysis and demographic trend identification
Machine learning model for predicting future urban growth
Integration with Grasshopper for 3D visualization and urban design optimization
Environmental impact assessment based on air quality data
Adaptive grid system for granular urban analysis

3. Installation
    1.Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/urbanpulse.git
    cd urbanpulse

    2.Install required dependencies:
    pip install -r requirements.txt

    3.Set up environment variables: Create a file named env_file.txt in the project root 
    and add your API keys:
    TRIMBLE_API_KEY=your_trimble_api_key
